# python-mouse-pointer-movement
Moves the mouse pointer

Build a mouse pathway on the screen in text file pw.txt

Run the path with "python mm.py run"

start with an empty text file pw.txt -OR- initially use a single right carat to redirect output of "mm.py get"

Then redirect output of "mm.py get" to pw.txt using double right carat (append)

pw.txt is a simple list of x,y screen coordinates, one per line, no parenthesis or braces

see sample pw.txt, a zig-zag pattern in this repository
